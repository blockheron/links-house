# links-house
This source code was originally written for an assignment. It uses OpenGL and C++ to render Link's house from Ocarina of Time, and to make a simple moveable first-person camrea. To run it, ensure LinksHouse.cpp is in the same folder as the LinksHouse directory. Run the executable 'test' on the command line.

**Controls:** Use the up/down arrow keys to move forward and backwards. Use the left/right arrow keys to look left and right. Press ESC to close the application.

**Acknowledgements:** [This camera tutorial was used as reference](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera). The assets in the LinksHouse directory were supplied by my class and belong to Nintendo.
